# Amazon-clone
I have successfully developed an Amazon clone using HTML and CSS. The clone replicates key features such as a header with a search bar and user options, a navigation bar for easy browsing, product cards displaying images, titles, prices, and buy buttons, and a footer with links and contact information.
